write a script using the AWS CLI that will export all Security Hub findings and convert to CSV format

the script reports the following error:
"jq: error (at <stdin>:216381): object ({"SeverityL...) is not valid in a csv row"

the script reports the following error:
"jq: error (at <stdin>:216381): Cannot iterate over string ("AwsIamUser")"

(infinite chatgpt loop between those two errors, so we switch things up)

write a script using python that will export all Security Hub findings and convert to CSV format

the script returns the following error:
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/csmith/tmp/chatgpt/02_enable_security_services/./export_security_hub_findings.py", line 28, in <module>
    product_name = finding['ProductFields']['ProductName']
KeyError: 'ProductName'
"

the output is missing the resource IDs for each finding

START OVER:

write a python script to export AWS security hub findings for a single region into json format
