HIGH,aws/health,"We would like to notify you about a change to how Amazon EventBridge Scheduler uses trust policies with IAM execution roles. Starting September 7, 2023, EventBridge Scheduler will only support restriction by the ScheduleGroup ARN instead of the Schedule ARN in the role's trust policy.  

Our records indicate that your account has one or more roles that limit access in the role's trust policy using the Schedule ARN. New roles that are created on and after September 7, 2023, can only limit access using the ScheduleGroup ARN. Accounts with a trust policy using the Schedule ARN will not be granted quota increases beyond the currently published default quotas [1]. If you have already been granted quota increases, those increases will be honored but cannot be increased further. Your existing execution roles that use Schedule ARN will continue to work as expected.

A list of your IAM role(s) affected by this change can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.

MEDIUM,aws/health,"You are receiving this notification because you use AWS Security Hub. Security Hub conducts regular reviews of its security controls to ensure they are up to date and are still considered best practices. Following a recent review, we have decided to remove the following controls from all security standards:

* CloudFront.2 (“CloudFront distributions should have origin access identity enabled”) [1]. A new control, CloudFront.13 (“CloudFront distributions should use origin access control”), was launched to replace CloudFront.2. Even though you are still able to use Origin Access Identity, AWS recommends that you use Origin Access Control [2]. As a result of this recommendation, we are making this update to ensure Security Hub’s recommendations reflect the latest best practices.

* S3.4 (“S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled”) [3]. As of January 2023, Amazon S3 configured default encryption on all new and existing unencrypted buckets to apply server-side encryption with S3 managed (truncated)",Other,997075698610
