write a script in two parts. the first part accepts an AWS EC2 instance ID and saves the describe-instances output in a variable, and include all tags in this inventory. The second part converts that description into a terraform template, also including all tags. 

(output is in python and jinja)

please use a bash script and the AWS CLI instead of python and jinja

(output is in two scripts)

combine the above into a single script

(output uses input and output files)

modify the script to use variables instead of an input and output file
