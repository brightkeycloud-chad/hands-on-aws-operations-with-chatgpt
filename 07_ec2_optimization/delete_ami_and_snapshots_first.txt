Interesting series of responses on my first try:

write a script using the AWS command line which generates a list of all AMIs in a single region, determines which of those AMIs are older than 180 days.  Using that list, deregister the AMI and delete the associated snapshots

the describe-images command will fail if executed after deregister-image, please modify accordingly

this script does not have any effective changes. please move the snapshot list generation before the AMI deregistration

(result actually has both inline code and functions to do both tasks, calling both of them in the script)
